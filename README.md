# Centipede
This is a simple, imperfect recreation of the Atari Centipede game using C++ and the SFML game creation library.

Here is an image of the game running:

This version only implements some of the elements:
 - Starship (player)
 - Mushroom
 - Spider
 - Centipede

Although this code is imperfect, I enjoyed making it and learned a lot regarding C++, CMAKE, and SFML.
